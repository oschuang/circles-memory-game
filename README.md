## Description

"Circles Memory Game" tests the users memory by generating sequences of button clicks which the user must repeat accurately.
This app was created using React.

## Features

The game features two modes:
A) Default mode: The user has endless chances to redo the rounds until they answer correctly
B) Strict mode: The user must restart from the first round when they give an incorrect answer

## Future Additions

Potential additions in the future include adding more modes to customize the game's difficulty.
For instance, allowing the user to change how fast the buttons flash when the CPU plays a sequence.
Another idea is adding more buttons to the game, or having the buttons shift their arrangement.
