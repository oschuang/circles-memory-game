## Technologies Used

The app was created using React and styled with SCSS.

## Features

The game features two modes:

A) Default mode: The user has endless chances to redo rounds until they get the sequence correct

B) Strict mode: The user must restart from the first round whenever they are incorrect

## Future Additions

Potential additions in the future include adding more modes to customize the game's difficulty.

For instance, allowing the user to change how fast the buttons flash when the CPU plays a sequence.

Another idea is adding more buttons to the game, or having the buttons shift their arrangement.
